# Problem 1

Read in the Mr.Trashwheel dataset and tidy data.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-1.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

The columns 15-17 were added because of the unnamed notes column at the
end of the dataset.

Read precipitation data 2017 and 2018 and clean.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
    ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
    ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine precipitation datasets month.names are character vectors
built into R mutate(month = month.name\[month\]) But there is a better
way below.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ##  2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ##  3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ##  4  2017     4  3.99 April     
    ##  5  2017     5  5.64 May       
    ##  6  2017     6  1.4  June      
    ##  7  2017     7  7.09 July      
    ##  8  2017     8  4.44 August    
    ##  9  2017     9  1.95 September 
    ## 10  2017    10  0    October   
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr.Trashwheel trash collector
in Baltimore Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and trash collected, include some specific
types of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final dataset.
Additionally, data sheets include month precipitation data.

# Problem 2

## Part a

Load NYC transit data frame and clean it.

``` r
nyc_transit = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")   %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, "YES" = "TRUE", "NO" = "FALSE"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information related to each entrance and exit for
each subway station in NYC. There are 1868 in the observations in the
data set and 19 variables. In order to clean the data, I used the
“clean\_names” function in the janitor package to change all variable
naming mechanisms to snake case. Furthermore, I only selected in
relevant variables into the data frame (line, station name, station
latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type and
ADA compliance). Furthermore, I recoded the entry variable from Yes/No
to a logical as True/False. The data are not tidy yet since the route
data (numbers and names) are listed in a wide format and have many NA
values.

Run code to figure out descriptives in data.

``` r
no_vending_df = nyc_transit %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO")
prop_entrance = round(nrow(filter(no_vending_df, entry == TRUE)) / nrow(no_vending_df),3)
```

While running some descriptives on the dataset, (1) I found that there
were 465 distinct stations (defined by both the station name and the
line). (2) Additionally, there were TRUE, 183 observations which were
ADA compliant. (3) Lastly, among the entrance/exits that don’t allow
vending, 37.7% of them allow entry.

## Part b

Cleaning and pivoting route number and names.

``` r
nyc_transit_tidy = 
nyc_transit %>% 
  mutate(
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name") %>% 
  drop_na("route_name")
```

The data are tidy after I reformatted the route data to list route
number and route name in a long format instead of a wide format.There
were 60 distinct stations that served the A train. Furthermore, of the
stations that served the A train, 17 were ADA compliant.

# Problem 3

Load and clean/tidy pols-month csv file.

``` r
month_pols = 
  tibble(
    month = c("01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07", "08", "09", "10", "11", "12"),
    month_name = month.name
  )

pols_month = 
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
pols_month_tidy =
  left_join(pols_month, month_pols) %>% 
  relocate(month_name) %>%
  mutate(
    president = ifelse(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop")) %>% 
   select(-month, -prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

    ## Joining, by = "month"

Load and clean/tidy the snp csv file.

``` r
month_snp = 
  tibble(
    month = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12"),
    month_name = month.name
  )

snp = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
snp_tidy = 
  left_join(snp, month_snp, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-month, -day) %>% 
  relocate(month_name)
```

Load and clean/tidy unemployment csv.

``` r
month_unemploy = 
  tibble(
    month = c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"),
    month_name = month.name
  )

unemploy = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
unemploy_tidy = 
  left_join(unemploy, month_unemploy, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-month) %>% 
  relocate(month_name) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

Join the datasets together.

``` r
prob3_df = 
  left_join(pols_month_tidy, snp_tidy, by = c('month_name' = 'month_name', 'year' = 'year')) %>% 
  left_join(unemploy_tidy, by = c('month_name' = 'month_name', 'year' = 'year'))
```

The final merged “prob3\_df” includes the “pols\_month\_tidy”,
“snp\_tidy” and “unemploy\_tidy” dataframes. The “pols\_month\_tidy”
dataframe contains 822 observations and 11 variables. I recoded the date
variable to be separate month and year columns. Also, I created a
president column and used “prez\_gop” and “prez\_dem” to denote whether
they were democrates or republicans. Furthermore, the dataset includes
variables for the number of democratic/republican governors, senators
and representatives. The “snp\_tidy” dataframe has 787 observations.
Similar to in the pols\_month\_tidy dataframe, I separated the month and
year variables into 2 separate columns. Lastly, the “unemploy\_tidy”
dataframe has 816 observations (after we pivoted the original file to
long from wide). There is also a month and year column along with a
percent column indicating the percentage of unemployment in each month
of a certain year.

Once we merged these three dataframes, the final dataset contains 822
and 11. This final dataframe contains all the same columns as in the 3
merged dataframes. The year range in this dataframe is 1947, 2015.
