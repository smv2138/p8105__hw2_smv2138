# Problem 1

Read in the Mr.Trashwheel dataset and tidy data.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-1.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

The columns 15-17 were added because of the unnamed notes column at the
end of the dataset.

Read precipitation data 2017 and 2018 and clean.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
    ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
    ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine precipitation datasets month.names are character vectors
built into R mutate(month = month.name\[month\]) But there is a better
way below.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2017     1  2.34 January   
    ##  2  2017     2  1.46 February  
    ##  3  2017     3  3.57 March     
    ##  4  2017     4  3.99 April     
    ##  5  2017     5  5.64 May       
    ##  6  2017     6  1.4  June      
    ##  7  2017     7  7.09 July      
    ##  8  2017     8  4.44 August    
    ##  9  2017     9  1.95 September 
    ## 10  2017    10  0    October   
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr.Trashwheel trash collector
in Baltimore Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and trash collected, include some specific
types of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final dataset.
Additionally, data sheets include month precipitation data.

# Problem 2

## Part a

Load NYC transit data frame and clean it.

``` r
nyc_transit = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")   %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, "YES" = "TRUE", "NO" = "FALSE"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

## Part b

Descriptive understanding of the data frame. (1) Finding out how many
distinct stations there are and (2) how many stations are ADA compliant.
(3) Lastly, finding the proportion of station entrances / exits without
vending that allow entrance.

``` r
nyc_transit %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name)
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 x 2
    ##    line     station_name            
    ##    <chr>    <chr>                   
    ##  1 4 Avenue 25th St                 
    ##  2 4 Avenue 36th St                 
    ##  3 4 Avenue 45th St                 
    ##  4 4 Avenue 53rd St                 
    ##  5 4 Avenue 59th St                 
    ##  6 4 Avenue 77th St                 
    ##  7 4 Avenue 86th St                 
    ##  8 4 Avenue 95th St                 
    ##  9 4 Avenue 9th St                  
    ## 10 4 Avenue Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr
    ## # ... with 455 more rows

``` r
nyc_transit %>% 
  count(entry, vending) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 3
    ##   entry vending     n
    ##   <chr> <chr>   <int>
    ## 1 FALSE NO        114
    ## 2 FALSE YES         1
    ## 3 TRUE  NO         69
    ## 4 TRUE  YES      1684

This dataset contains information related to each entrance and exit for
each subway station in NYC. There are 1868 in the observations in the
data set and 19 variables. In order to clean the data, I used the
“clean\_names” function in the janitor package to change all variable
naming mechanisms to snake case. Furthermore, I only selected in
relevant variables into the data frame (line, station name, station
latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type and
ADA compliance). Furthermore, I recoded the entry variable from Yes/No
to a logical as True/False. The data here are tidy after making these
adjustments to the formatting of the dataframe.

1)  While running some descriptives on the dataset, I found that there
    was 465 distinct stations (defined by both the station name and the
    line). (2) Additionally, I found that there was 468 observations
    which are ADA compliant. (3) Lastly, among the entrance/exits that
    don’t allow vending, 37.7% of them allow entry.

# Problem 3

Load and clean/tidy pols-month csv file.

``` r
month_pols = 
  tibble(
    month = c("01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07", "08", "09", "10", "11", "12"),
    month_name = month.name
  )

pols_month = 
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
pols_month_tidy =
  left_join(pols_month, month_pols) %>% 
  relocate(month_name) %>%
  mutate(
    president = recode(
      prez_dem, `1` = "dem", `0` = "gop")) %>% 
   select(-month, -prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

    ## Joining, by = "month"

Load and clean/tidy the snp csv file.

``` r
month_snp = 
  tibble(
    month = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12"),
    month_name = month.name
  )

snp = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
snp_tidy = 
  left_join(snp, month_snp, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-month, -day) %>% 
  relocate(month_name)
```

Load and clean/tidy unemployment csv.

``` r
month_unemploy = 
  tibble(
    month = c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"),
    month_name = month.name
  )

unemploy = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percent"
  ) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
unemploy_tidy = 
  left_join(unemploy, month_unemploy, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-month) %>% 
  relocate(month_name) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

Join the datasets together.

``` r
prob3_df = 
  left_join(pols_month_tidy, snp_tidy, by = c('month_name' = 'month_name', 'year' = 'year')) %>% 
  left_join(unemploy_tidy, by = c('month_name' = 'month_name', 'year' = 'year'))
```

The final merged “prob3\_df” includes the “pols\_month\_tidy”,
“snp\_tidy” and “unemploy\_tidy” dataframes. The “pols\_month\_tidy”
dataframe contains 822 observations. I recoded the date variable to be
separate month and year columns. Also, I created a president column and
used “prez\_gop” and “prez\_dem” to denote whether they were democrates
or republicans. Furthermore, the dataset includes variables for the
number of democratic/republican governors, senators and representatives.
The “snp\_tidy” dataframe gass 787 observations. Similar to in the
pols\_month\_tidy dataframe, I separated the month and year variables
into 2 separate columns. Lastly, the “unemploy\_tidy” dataframe has 816
observations (after we pivoted the original file to long from wide).
There is also a month and year column along with a percent column
indicating the percentage of unemployment in each month of a certain
year.

Once we merged these three dataframes, the final dataset contains 822
and 11. This final dataframe contains all the same columns as in the 3
merged dataframes. The year range in this dataframe is
